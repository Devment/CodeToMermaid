# Code to Mermaid
This CLI tool give you the opportunity to create a [mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) class diagram out of your source code.

You could use this for example to generate a class diagram of one (or multiple) file' to document or explain changes.

### Supported languages
- Java (using [JavaParser](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser))
  
Planned:
- JavaScript (using [this Parser](https://github.com/googlearchive/caja/blob/master/src/com/google/caja/parser/js/Parser.java))
- C#

Feel free to offer other languages. But it would help a lot if you could also refer to a Java Parser for this language.
